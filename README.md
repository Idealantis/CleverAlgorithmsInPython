Clever Algorithms in Python (CAIP) is an extension of the body of knowledge started by Jason Browlee : [Clever Algorithms](http://www.cleveralgorithms.com/)
Nature Inspired Programming Recipes. 

CAIP was started in 2011 with the intention of bringing this to Python. But this was prematurely abandoned because of time constraints. Now we have restarted this. The reasons and goals for doing this remains the same [See here](http://www.saipanyam.net/2011/06/clever-algorithms-python.html).
The change is we will complete this with new examples and add explore the optimization techniques and mechanics used.

### Algorithm Classification ###

Clever Algorithms have been classified in to the following broad categories:

* Stochastic Algorithms
* Evolutionary Algorithms
* Swarm Algorithms
* Probabilistic Algorithms
* Physical Algorithms
* Immune Algorithms
* Neural Algorithms

### How do I get set up? ###

* Summary of set up
* Configuration
* Dependencies
* Database configuration
* How to run tests
* Deployment instructions

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Writing tests
* Code review
* Other guidelines

### Who do I talk to? ###

* sai.panyam@idealantis.com
* www.idealantis.com

### Running The Algorithms ###
* Navigate to src/Tests/
* Run python -m pytest *testSuiteName.py*  -s 
* *Note :* Make sure pytest is installed
